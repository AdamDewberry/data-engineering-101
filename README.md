## Create git repo

A repository is a project or place to keep your code, this area allows people to work together and collaborate through 'branching'.

Create a new directory (folder) somewhere on your machine.

    mkdir my-project

**Note:** Do not have any whitespace in the name.

Enter the new directory my-project

    cd my-project

Create a git repository:

    git init


Create your README which contains instruction of what your project does and how to use it.

After you've created the README.md file, stage it by `add`ing it.

    git add README.md

Attach a message to the commit to tell people what changes you've made.

    git commit -m "First commit, woo!! Added the README"

Then push (send) it to the central repo to be added in:

    git push origin master
