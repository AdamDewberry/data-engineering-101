This site is a structured, practical guide on learning enough Python, SQL and systems to get a first job in development or as a junior data engineering.

Though the focus is on data engineering, the essential skills taught will support a career in data science or data analysis - though you will need additional mathematics and statistical understanding which this course does not provide.


What this course is not:  
A silver bullet, there is no substitute for practise and hours spent coding.
