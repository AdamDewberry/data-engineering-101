# Data types and data structures

In Python, everything is an object, every object has a type.

## Objects
Objects are thing like variables, functions and classes. Let's start by opening ipython and assigning a value.

    x = 1000

Congratulations, you've just assigned your first object!

The value of `1000` has been loaded into the computers memory (RAM) and been assigned the key of `x`.

If you 'call' your variable, `x` to retrieve the value, `x` points to the bytes assigned in memory to the value of `1000`.
