# Version controle with git

Version control allows us to track changes, collaborate and roll back to stable versions of software. Git is a tool which we use to version our code.

## Create git repo

A repository is a project or place to keep your code, this area allows people to work together and collaborate through 'branching'.

Create a new directory (folder) somewhere on your machine.

    mkdir my-project

**Note:** Do not have any whitespace in the name.

Enter the new directory my-project

    cd my-project

Create a git repository:

    git init

Create your README which contains instruction of what your project does and how to use it.

After you've created the README.md file, stage it by `add`ing it.

    git add README.md

Attach a message to the commit to tell people what changes you've made.

    git commit -m "First commit, woo!! Added the README"

Then push (send) it to the central repo to be added in:

    git push origin master

**Note:** You should only push to master on your first commit and then use branching and merging. If you're continually pushing to master, you're likely doing something wrong or have broken working pattens.
## Branching

We use 'branches' to take a 'copy' of the code, make changes and then push (send) it back to the origin (central repository). Here we can then create a pull request, where someone can review your code and if accepted, merge it to the master/main branch.

    git checkout -b my-new-cool-feature

Now you are working in your own area, safe to tinker away from the master branch.

From here, make your changes, `add`, `commit` and push them to the remote repo for review and merge. The difference on push is:

    git push origin my-new-cool-feature

After you have pushed your branch to the remote repo / origin, you can merge the code to the master branch.

## Pulling changes from the remote repo to local repo

To connect our `master` branch with the origin `master` branch, we must set the upstream pointer, this tell our local branch where to find the remote branch:

    git branch --set-upstream-to=origin/master master

To pull (or grab) the changes and updates, use:

    git pull


## Cloning

To take a local copy of a project which is connected to the original remote repository, you can clone the repo.

Try with:

    git clone git@github.com:AdamDewberry/data-engineering-101.git

This will create a new directory called data-engineering-101 and will copy all of the files and git history to your machine.
