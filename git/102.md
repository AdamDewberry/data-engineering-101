Setting Different Git Profiles

# What?

Many people use a single account for remote repo services like GitHub and BitBucket, they attribute different email addresses, say your work address and person email, to preserve an ongoing history and catalogue for your contributions. If you commit to an open source project, a public repo, these this history will be attributed to your single account. It's also simpler to manage one account.

Say you want to create different local git profiles for your side projects or contributions and you need to list specific profile information or aliases, you can use local and global configuration settings.

Check your global git config in `~/.gitconfig`:

    cat `~/.gitconfig`

    [user]
    	name = <your name>
    	email = <your email address>
    [core]
    	editor = atom --wait
    [credential]
    	helper = store
    [credential "github.com"]
    	useHttpPath = true

You'll see there's also a local config within your project `/.git/config`. Note, this directory is hidden by the dot prefix.

Yours may look like this:

    [core]
        repositoryformatversion = 0
        filemode = true
        bare = false
        logallrefupdates = true
        ignorecase = true
        precomposeunicode = true
    [remote "origin"]
        url = git@github.com:<your-github-username>/<your-repo>.git
        fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*
        gh-resolved = base
    [branch "master"]
        remote = origin
        merge = refs/heads/master
    [user]
        name = Adam Dewberry
        email = 38838996+AdamDewberry@users.noreply.github.com




git config user.name
git config --list
git config --global user.name "Alvin J. Alexander"
git config --global user.email [your email address here]
