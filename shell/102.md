# Shell 102

##Â Alias

You can "alias" commands to create shortcuts. If there is a popular set of commands or inputs you can create a alias which points to those commands and executes them, for example, I would like to alias opening the Google Chrome Browser.

    alias chrome="/usr/bin/open -a \"/Applications/Google Chrome.app\""

To open this website from the terminal, execute:

    chrome https://dewberry.dev/
