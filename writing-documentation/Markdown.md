# Markdown

## What?

Markdown is (confusingly) a markup language.

A markup language is a syntactic computing language of annotations which renders text and images based on the tags you give it, the syntax itself will not be rendered. HTML and XML are examples of a markup language.

Markdown files have the extension `.md`.

## Why?

Having a standard way to format and render information allows us to be consistent across devices, operating systems and includes all instructions needed to create clear, readable documents.

A common use for markdown is to write instruction files, like a `README.md`. A README contains all of the information, dependencies and instructions needed to run and contribute to a project.

## How?

We use hashes to define headings:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/AdamDewberry/cd9c8ba9fd22daf33a81013ab06740d2.js"></script>

# This is the highest order heading
## This is a sub-heading
### This is a sub-sub-heading

This is an example of a list / bullet points:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/AdamDewberry/c0f686d9b19aa93a12b81e0175de02b5.js"></script>

- Text A
- Text B
- Text C

This is an example of a numbered list:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/AdamDewberry/74ac09aa09667a03fe3b166bc5034fc8.js"></script>

1. Point 1
1. Point 2
1. Point 3

To write bold text:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/AdamDewberry/2d908b184caf41223d0ef0311a6be0be.js"></script>

**This is bold text**  
__This is bold text__

To write test in italics:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/AdamDewberry/9981cd177453dad02cd0bf6e29d076ae.js"></script>

*This text is in italics*  
_This text is in italics_

Use ticks to define a piece of code:  

<script src="https://gist.github.com/AdamDewberry/bb47da28588a57210d1f2b2838c4a2d1.js"></script>

`my_arg = 5`

To define a code block, indent the code four spaces or use a tab.

Another way to write a code block is with three ticks.

<script src="https://gist.github.com/AdamDewberry/7ee99b3897022e28750d788fe98bb723.js"></script>

    my_arg = 5
    your_arg = 6

Hyperlinks look like this:
