# README.md

## What?

A README contains all of the instructions needed to run and contribute to a project.

## Why?

If someone tried to run your project, how would they know how to do it? Where should they begin, what do they need to know?

If there was no documentation, the project may be near useless if it was to be run by another person or team, they wouldn't know how; a README solves this and transfers knowledge.

No one person works on the same project forever, in the same team or company; if you were to inherit a project or join a team which has an established code base, write your like you'd expect there's to be - clear, concise and informative.

## How?

Create a file called `README.md` in the root of your project and populate it with lots of lovely [markdown](./Markdown.md), in clear sections detailing all the relevant information to the project. There should never be domain knowledge of the code in your head, everything important should be documented.

You should include sections such as:

- Introduction
- Getting started
- Dependencies
- Installation
- How to run this project
- Contributing
- License

Bearing in mind you may not need all of these, they are general guidelines of the sort of information you should include.

When writing a README, imagine that you're seeing the project for the first time, what information do you need to get it running? Is there any required knowledge in your head that a new user would need? What are the common points of failure, specific steps or edge cases?


The following are good examples of what a README should look like:  
- [Python](https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/master/README.rst)
- [AWS CLI](https://github.com/aws/aws-cli/blob/develop/README.rst)
- [Terraform](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/blob/master/README.md)
