# Writing A README

## What?

A README contains all of the instructions needed to run and contribute to a project.

## How?

Create a file called `README.md` and populate it with lots of lovely markdown, in clear sections detailing all the relevant information to the project. There should never be domain knowledge of the code in your head, everything important should be documented.

You should include sections such as:

- Introduction
- Getting started
- Dependencies
- Installation
- How to run this project
- Contributing
- License

Bearing in mind you may not need all of these, they are general guidelines of the sort of information you should include.


The following are good examples of what a README should look like:  
- [Python](https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/master/README.rst)
- [AWS CLI](https://github.com/aws/aws-cli/blob/develop/README.rst)
- [Terraform](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/blob/master/README.md)
